LBE heat exchanger designs for the NioWave neutron converter design. 

The following files calculate the same values as the project Excel sheets, but these are used to optomize the piping diameters of the gas-gap calorimeter and pressurized water jacket designs. 

The pipe and tubes dimensions are standard diameters and wall thicknesses of available materials in stainless steel 316. Three .csv files are produced with the best resulting dimenions, head losses, heat transfer rates, flow rates, and temperatures. From these files the radial temperature profiles are produced as well. 

Each design is sized with the log-mean temperature difference method and the effectiveness NtU method.
